Note:
This article assumes

You have a Dockerhub Account, Microsoft Azure Account and a Github Account.
You have git installed on your local machine.
Have authenticated into github using your cli.
Change the name of the storage account name in .github/workflow/main.yaml line: 17 and 14

Deployment Of Application
Step 1:
Create Service Principle

Create a new service principle and grant owner permission to this service principle using the command bellow.
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "temp-github-action-svp" --role owner --scopes /subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID} --sdk-auth
Ignore the warning: Option '--sdk-auth' has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Copy and paste the output after creating service principle in the format bellow in your clip board.
{
  "clientId": "",
  "clientSecret": "",
  "subscriptionId": "",
  "tenantId": "",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "",
  "managementEndpointUrl": ""
}
Step2:
Save service principle credentials in github secrets

Open github and create a new repository with any name of your choice
Open the repository and click on settings.
Scroll down and click on secrets and select actions.
Click on new repository secrets.
Copy and past the output of creation of the service princlicple in the bellow form
{
  "clientId": "",
  "clientSecret": "",
  "subscriptionId": "",
  "tenantId": "",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "",
  "managementEndpointUrl": ""
}
Click on save
Step3:
Test Pipeline

push the code to your repository.
Navigate to Actions and see your pipeline being triggered by github actions.
Wait for the deployment to complete and test your endpoint.
Note: The endpoint can be tested using the url generated by the container app with /docs append to it. Example: https://stroke0modelm.victoriousstone-80e7c8c7.centralus.azurecontainerapps.io/docs
